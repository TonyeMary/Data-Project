## 1. Crime & Socioeconomic Factors in Saskatchewan: A Data-Driven Analysis
This data-driven dashboard provides valuable insights into the socioeconomic factors influencing crime in Saskatchewan’s communities. The strong correlation between unemployment, low income, and education gaps with high crime rates suggests that economic and educational improvements could lead to long-term crime reduction in North Battleford, Meadow Lake, and Prince Albert.

**Features:**

•	Visualization of crime rate in five Saskatchewan cities over time

•	Low-Income Measure (LIM) after tax

•	Unemployment rate

•	Education rate

•	Data Source: Stat Canada


**Tools Used:**

•	PowerBI for dashboard creation

•	DAX for complex calculations

•	Power Query to manipulate data sources

**The dynamic dashboard provides the following insights:**

**i. Higher Crime Rates in North Battleford, Meadow Lake, and Prince Albert:**
From 2018 to 2022, these three communities consistently reported higher crime rates compared to Regina, Saskatoon, and the provincial average. This suggests that smaller urban centers, particularly in northern Saskatchewan, may face unique socio-economic challenges contributing to crime.

**ii. Economic Hardship Correlates with Higher Crime:**
2021 Census Data shows that unemployment rates in North Battleford, Meadow Lake, and Prince Albert were higher than in larger cities.
A significant percentage of residents in these communities fall under the Low-Income Measure (LIM) after tax, meaning a greater portion of the population struggles financially.
Economic hardship can lead to increased property crime and violent crime, as financial stressors contribute to theft, drug-related offenses, and social instability.

**iii. Education Gaps Are a Contributing Factor:**
The percentage of people with no formal education in these high-crime communities is 50% higher than in Regina, Saskatoon, and the provincial average.
Low education levels are often linked to higher unemployment and lower earning potential, which in turn increases financial insecurity and the likelihood of engaging in criminal activity.
Education also impacts social mobility, meaning people in these communities may face more difficulty escaping cycles of poverty and crime.

**iv. Urban vs. Smaller City Disparities:**
Larger cities like Regina and Saskatoon have lower crime rates despite having larger populations. This suggests they may have better access to social programs, employment opportunities, and educational institutions, which help mitigate crime.
Smaller communities may lack adequate law enforcement resources, job opportunities, and social services, leading to higher rates of property and violent crime.

**Potential Implications & Next Steps:**

Targeted Intervention: Policies focused on education and job creation in high-crime communities could reduce both unemployment and crime rates.
Community-Based Crime Prevention: Increased investment in youth programs, skills training, and economic development could help mitigate risk factors.
Improved Social Services: Expanding mental health and addiction support programs in these areas may reduce crime related to substance abuse and financial distress.
